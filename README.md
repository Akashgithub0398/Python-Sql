Conquered Data Analysis with Python and MySQL!

I recently used Python for some in-depth data cleaning in Jupyter Notebook. 
After that, I migrated the cleaned data to a MySQL database for further analysis.
Here, you'll find the codes I used for both, Data Cleaning as well as for Analysing.
(Check for Pyhton_code and MySQL_code)
