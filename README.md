Conquered Data Analysis with Python and MySQL!

I recently used Python for some in-depth data cleaning in Jupyter Notebook. After that, I migrated the cleaned data to a MySQL database for further analysis. Here's what I was able to uncover:

Product Superstars: I identified the top 10 revenue generators among all products. This helps prioritize product marketing and development efforts.

Regional Powerhouses:  Drilled down to discover the top 3 best-selling products in each region. This provides valuable insights for regional sales strategies.

Monthly Sales Trends:  Unveiled monthly total sales figures, providing a clear year-over-year view (e.g., Year, Month, Sales). This helps track sales performance and identify seasonal trends.

YoY Growth Comparison:  Analyzed month-over-month sales growth between 2022 and 2023 (e.g., Jan 2022 vs. Jan 2023). This helps assess sales progress and identify areas for improvement.

Category Sales Champions:  For each product category, I pinpointed the month with the highest sales. This can inform strategic inventory management and promotions.
